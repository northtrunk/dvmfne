# Network Reporting Configuration
#   Enabling "REPORT" will configure a socket-based reporting
#   system that will send the configuration and other items
#   to a another process (local or remote) that may process
#   the information for some useful purpose, like a web dashboard.
#
#   Report         - True to enable, False to disable
#   ReportInterval - Seconds between reports
#   ReportPort     - TCP port to listen on if "REPORT_NETWORKS" = NETWORK
#   ReportClients  - comma separated list of IPs you will allow clients
#                    to connect on. Entering a * will allow all.

#
# Logging Configuration
#   This allows the logger to be configured without chaning the individual
#   python logger stuff. LOG_FILE should be a complete path/filename for *your*
#   system -- use /dev/null for non-file handlers.
#
#   LogHandlers    - may be any of the following, please, no spaces in the
#                    list if you use several:
#                      null
#                      console
#                      console-timed
#                      file
#                      file-timed
#                      syslog
#   LogLevel       - may be any of the standard syslog logging levels, though
#                    as of now, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and CRITICAL are the only ones
#                    used.
#   RawPacketTrace -
#   AllowActTrans  - flag indicating whether peers can transfer activity logging data to
#                    the network core
#   AllowDiagTrans - flag indicating whether peers can transfer diagnostics logging data to
#                    the network core
#   ActivityLogFile-
#   DiagLogPath    - path to the directory to store diagnostics logs, this should always
#                    end with a trailing /
